npm run dev-we have to run the npm run dev to start the server. We should opened the folder which has package.json file.

for example: in this project front end folder has package.json file. we have to run the npm run dev in front end folder.

if we run the npm run dev in the food_del folder then it will not work.
it shows the error.
to be cleared we have to run the npm run dev in the front_end folder.
i.e. documents/sriram repo/python/food_del/front_end-where we have to run the npm run dev.
     documents/sriram repo/python/food_del-here it wont work.
